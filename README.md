# ShiKai Snacks


This is a single-page, react-based web app that allows users to view, rate and comment on a variety of posted snacks
from a snack list. A user must create an account and log in before being allowed to post a review or edit previous posts they wrote.


# Getting Started

Please review the ReactReadMe file in this project to get this app started on your machine.

# Purpose

The purpose of this project was to collaborate with a fellow coder and utilize react to build a full stack web application.

# Planned Additions and Upgrades

We made the decision early on to not use React-Redux. In hindsight, this was a setback. Our next steps will include integrating Redux for state management.
We will continue to improve styling and UX/UI as well as adding additional features for users to interact with.

# The Technologies Used
